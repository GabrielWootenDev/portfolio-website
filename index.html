    <h2>
        A little about myself
    </h2>
    <p>For a long time after High School, I decided to spend some time to really discover myself and what I want my life to be. I have a wide array of interests but along the path I found a deep curiousity in technolgy, especially whe nit came to the subject of the internet and everything it contains as well as the applications I began to use in my day to day life. After all my time spent online I finally realized that I wanted to learn how it all worked, become a part of that world, and hopefully one day I can leave my own mark on cyberspace, however small or large.</p>
    <p>Shortly after I began my program with Thinkful, I really understood that this was truly my passion, and I can't wait to learn something new each day and to continue learning all sorts of programming languages in the future!</p>
    <p>If anyone needs a new developer or would like to collaborate on a project feel free to contact me! I'm always looking for new opportunites to learn and grow my skills and work with my peers.</p>
