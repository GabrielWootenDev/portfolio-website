            <h2>A little about myself</h2>
            <p>For a long time after High School, I decided to spend some time to
            really discover myself and what I want my life to be. I have a wide
            array of interests but along the path I found a deep curiousity in
            technolgy, especially when it came to the subject of the internet and
            everything it contains as well as the applications I began to use in
            my day to day life. After all my time spent online I finally realized
            that I wanted to learn how it all worked, become a part of that world,
            and hopefully one day I can leave my own mark on cyberspace, however
            small or large.</p>
            <p>Shortly after I began my program with Thinkful, I really understood
            that this was truly my passion. I'm currently learning JavaScript,
            HTML, and CSS. I also can't wait to learn something new each day and
            to continue learning all sorts of programming languages in the future!</p>
            <p>If anyone needs a new developer or would like to collaborate on a 
            project feel free to <a href="#contacts">contact me!</a> I'm always looking for new opportunites 
            to learn and grow my skills and work with my peers.</p>
