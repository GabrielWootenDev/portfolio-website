                        <h2>A little about myself</h2>
                        <p>For a long time after High School, I decided to spend some time to
                        really discover myself and what I want my life to be. I have a wide
                        array of interests but along the path I found a deep curiousity in
                        technolgy, especially when it came to the subject of the internet and
                        everything it contains as well as the applications I began to use in
                        my day to day life. After all my time spent online I finally realized
                        that I wanted to learn how it all worked, become a part of that world,
                        and hopefully one day I can leave my own mark on cyberspace, however
                        small or large.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after I began my program with Thinkful, I really understood
                        that this was truly my passion. I'm currently learning JavaScript,
                        HTML, and CSS. I also can't wait to learn something new each day and
                        to continue learning all sorts of programming languages in the future!</p>
                        <p>If anyone needs a new developer or would like to collaborate on a 
                        project feel free to <a href="#contacts">contact me!</a> I'm always looking for new opportunites 
                        to learn and grow my skills and work with my peers.</p>
